# Challenge #5 | CSS Demystified

This is a bigger challenge that might take some time to complete. That's fine!

## How to approach the challenge

Break things down into smaller parts as much as you can, and approach it in a way that you are comfortable.

If there are certain parts you aren't sure about, don't give up. Do your best, and come and ask in the Discord if there are tricky parts that you're having trouble with.

## Provided files

- Design as Figma and .jpg files
- 3 different screen sizes of the design
- Images & text
- Style Guide

## Challenge

For this challenge, you can focus on the layout/CSS, but if you want and have experience with other technologies, you can also look at adding functionality as well.

You will have to use a few different media queries in this one, with certain parts only being visible, or changing at different screen sizes.

## Feedback or if you get stuck

I am not providing solutions to these challenges, they are for you to complete. If you finish one and would like feedback, or if you get stuck, jump into the Discord. There is a channel devoted to the challenges from this course.

I would suggest uploading what you have to [CodePen](https://codepen.io) so that you can share your code easily with others.
