# Challenge #4 | CSS Demystified

For this challenge, you are only provided with a design, and no starting files.

You must do your best to create the layout using HTML & CSS.

## Provided files

- Design as Figma and .jpg
- 3 different screen sizes of the design
- Images & text
- Style Guide

## Challenge

For this we want to complete the layout provided. I have provided the reCAPTCHA as an image, but if you're feeling adventurous you could look at making it functional!

### Extra challenge

- Is there a way you could create this layout without a media query?

## Feedback or if you get stuck

I am not providing solutions to these challenges, they are for you to complete. If you finish one and would like feedback, or if you get stuck, jump into the Discord. There is a channel devoted to the challenges from this course.

I would suggest uploading what you have to [CodePen](https://codepen.io) so that you can share your code easily with others.
