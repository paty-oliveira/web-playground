        There's nothing better than a homemade burger. Everyone loves them,
        they're easy to make and, if made with quality, fresh ingredients (and
        not over laden with greasy stuff), they certainly don't have to be
        unhealthy, especially if served with a salad. Once you've mastered this
        tasty basic recipe, you can make it your own with different herbs,
        spices and toppings. The sky's the limit - that's why cooking is so
        exciting.
