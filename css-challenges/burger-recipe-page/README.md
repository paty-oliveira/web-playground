# Challenge #3 | CSS Demystified

For this challenge, you are only provided with a design, and no starting files

You must do your best to create the layout using HTML & CSS.

## Provided files

For this, and all challenges, I have provided you with:

- Design as Figma and .jpg
- Desktop and mobile versions of the design
- Images & text
- Style Guide

## Important consideration for the lists

You will notice that the text in the lists wraps under the bullet or number. DO NOT reproduce it like this. Keep the normal behavior where the bullet or number hangs off the right side. There is no list function in Figma, so I had to make due with this in the design file.

## Feedback or if you get stuck

I am not providing solutions to these challenges, they are for you to complete. If you finish one and would like feedback, or if you get stuck, jump into the Discord. There is a channel devoted to the challenges from this course.

I would suggest uploading what you have to [CodePen](https://codepen.io) so that you can share your code easily with others. If you create a new CodePen, you can drag your files from your computer into the CodePen to make it very fast.
