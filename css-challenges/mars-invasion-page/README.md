# Challenge #6 | CSS Demystified

A smaller challenge that is well suited to using CSS Grid.

## How to approach the challenge

As usual, break things down and plan things out from the start. There are some moving parts in this one.

## Provided files

- Design as Figma and .jpg files
- 3 different screen sizes of the design
- Images & text
- Style Guide

## Challenge

This is a fantastic challenge to put your CSS Grid skills to the test, including re-ordering content at different screen sizes.

For this challenge, you can focus on the layout/CSS, but if you want and have experience with other technologies, you can also look at making the countdown functional as well.

## Feedback or if you get stuck

I am not providing solutions to these challenges, they are for you to complete. If you finish one and would like feedback, or if you get stuck, jump into the Discord. There is a channel devoted to the challenges from this course.

I would suggest uploading what you have to [CodePen](https://codepen.io) so that you can share your code easily with others.
